# Video-compression-using-DCT-matlab-
Apply the DCT algorithm to a 5-second video. 
I use the DCT algorithm in Matlab and apply the technique to a 5-second video. 

<h2> The Steps: </h2>
1. load a video.<br>
2. write a new video file to load the compressed one.<br>
3. check if the file has frames.<br>
4. read frames.<br>
5. convert the frames into grayscale.<br>
6. apply duct on gray frames.<br>
7. get important coeff for dct to apply them on the frames.<br>
8. recover the pixels using the inverse 2D DCT.<br>
9. Normalize the compressed frame to the range 0-1.<br>
10. write the new file.<br>
